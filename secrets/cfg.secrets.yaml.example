# Encrypt a copy of this file using `sops --encrypt` and store it in one of the
# supported locations:
#   1. Set the SHINX_SECRETS_FILE environment variable to an absolute path that
#      points at the encrypted file.
#   2. Provide a `secrets` flake input whose root contains `cfg.secrets.yaml`.
#   3. Place an encrypted `cfg.secrets.yaml` alongside this template
#      (secrets/cfg.secrets.yaml).
# The resulting encrypted file will be decrypted at evaluation time so that
# sensitive values (email, SSH keys, network addresses, â€¦) never need to live
# in the repository in plain text.
